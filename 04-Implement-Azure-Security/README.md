- Primer to OAuth and OpenID Connect - History of Authentication
- Primer to OAuth and OpenID Connect - Identity Provider
- What is OAuth?
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow
- OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow
  - When both auth code and access token both comes from the broser
  - Useful when all code is client side - Angular JS, Java script etc
- OAuth 2.0 - Overview
- OAuth with Azure AD - Overview
- Quick Look into OAuth when logging into Azure
- OAuth 2.0 for ASP.Net Core
- The Access Tokens
- OAuth 2.0 - Accessing Blob storage
- Azure AD - Multi-Factor Authentication
- OpenID Connect
  - Built on the OAuth 2.0 protocol and uses an additional JSON Web Token (JWT)
  - An identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework
  - It allows third-party applications to verify the identity of the end-user and to obtain basic user profile information.
  - It is not controlled by any one website or service provider
  You control how much personal information you choose to share with websites that accept OpenIDs
